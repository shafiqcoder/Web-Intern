use script tag before the closing tag of body, 

var cool=true; (variable declaration statement)
console.log(cool) (function call statement)

const varivables cant be changed.
'use strict'; with this mode ,you cannot define variable without decalaration. its good practice.
var variable refer to as function scope variable.
let and const refer to as block scope variable.
Variable declaration tip: use const by default , use let if value needs to be changed.
