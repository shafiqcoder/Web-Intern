use script tag before the closing tag of body, 

var cool=true; (variable declaration statement)
console.log(cool) (function call statement)
var and let variable can be updated.
const varivables cant be changed.
'use strict'; with this mode ,you cannot define variable without decalaration. its good practice.

let and const refer to as block scope variable.
Variable declaration tip: use const by default , use let if value needs to be changed. 
As a convention ,varibale name should start with small letter, unless they are class/prototype.
