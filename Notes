use script tag before the closing tag of body, 
var cool=true; (variable declaration statement)
console.log(cool) (function call statement)
var and let variable can be updated.
const varivables cant be changed.
'use strict'; with this mode ,you cannot define variable without decalaration. its good practice.
var variable refer to as function scope variable.
let and const refer to as block scope variable.
Variable declaration tip: use const by default , use let if value needs to be changed. 
As a convention ,varibale name should start with small letter, unless they are class/prototype.
variable name can only be created with alphabets underscore _ and dollar sign $.
variable cases;
camel case	iAmCamelCase=true;
Upper camel case	IAmCamelCase=true;	Convention for classes.
snake case	this_is_snake_case=true;
-------
eslint.org	Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code, It gives feedback on your code.
prettier.io	An opinionated code formatter
---------
console.log is for debugging therefore not suitable to ship to the client.
variable created inside the function scope not available outside unless its return.
function parameters function hello(first,second), when calling function its argument hello(Shafiq,coder).
JS functions are values it self. they can be stored in a variable.
a function without name is anonymous fn.
function expression-store a function in a variable.
---------
JavaScript Hoisting:
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted.(e.g. var y, var x, var hello,)
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.
Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.
All functions are hoisted in JS except function defined with function expression.
-----
Arrow functions
arrow functions are anonymous functions and concise.
skinny arrow ->
fat arrow => 
dont need explicit return 
one liners.
if you have two parameters in arrow function you must have parenthesis. e.g. const add=(a,b=3)=>a+b; but in single parameter no need. e.g. const inchToCm=inches=>inches*2.54;
-----
curly brackets {} in js can be block of code or creation of object.
